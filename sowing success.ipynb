The data was taken from the DataCamp depository and all right for it belong to them.\n","### The code, however, is my work :)\n","\n","Measuring essential soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value is an important aspect of assessing soil condition. However, it can be an expensive and time-consuming process, which can cause farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure based on their budget constraints.\n","\n","Farmers have various options when it comes to deciding which crop to plant each season. Their primary objective is to maximize the yield of their crops, taking into account different factors. One crucial factor that affects crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field, which can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. Each crop has an ideal soil condition that ensures optimal growth and maximum yield.\n","\n","A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert for assistance in selecting the best crop for his field. They've provided you with a dataset called `soil_measures.csv`, which contains:\n","\n","- `\"N\"`: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil\n","- `\"P\"`: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil\n","- `\"K\"`: Potassium content ratio in the soil\n","- `\"pH\"` value of the soil\n","- `\"crop\"`: categorical values that contain various crops (target variable).\n","\n","Each row in this dataset represents various measures of the soil in a particular field. Based on these measurements, the crop specified in the `\"crop\"` column is the optimal choice for that field.  \n","\n","In this project, you will build multi-class classification models to predict the type of `\"crop\"` and identify the single most importance feature for predictive performance."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","metadata":{"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":43,"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","lastExecutedAt":1709820355808,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# All required libraries are imported here for you.\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n# Load the dataset\ncrops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n\n#Â Write your code here\ncrops","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":320,"type":"dataFrame"}},"visualizeDataframe":false},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["        N   P   K        ph    crop\n","0      90  42  43  6.502985    rice\n","1      85  58  41  7.038096    rice\n","2      60  55  44  7.840207    rice\n","3      74  35  40  6.980401    rice\n","4      78  42  42  7.628473    rice\n","...   ...  ..  ..       ...     ...\n","2195  107  34  32  6.780064  coffee\n","2196   99  15  27  6.086922  coffee\n","2197  118  33  30  6.362608  coffee\n","2198  117  32  34  6.758793  coffee\n","2199  104  18  30  6.779833  coffee\n","\n","[2200 rows x 5 columns]\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","# from sklearn import metrics\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","crops = pd.read_csv(\"soil_measures.csv\")\n","\n","print(crops)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"37be16c1-fcf9-4316-80dc-5d835ac79476","metadata":{},"source":["### Exploratory data analysis"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"id":"eea5ee7a-ba48-40c5-b72a-8f4cc2c071f4","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"lastExecutedAt":1709820355860,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# print the keys\nprint(crops.keys())\n\n# Check shape of the data\nprint(crops.shape)\n\n# Print missing values for each column\nprint(crops.isna().sum().sort_values())\n\n# Print the list of counts of distinct values of the crop column\nprint(crops['crop'].value_counts())","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":616,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Index(['N', 'P', 'K', 'ph', 'crop'], dtype='object')\n","(2200, 5)\n","N       0\n","P       0\n","K       0\n","ph      0\n","crop    0\n","dtype: int64\n","rice           100\n","maize          100\n","jute           100\n","cotton         100\n","coconut        100\n","papaya         100\n","orange         100\n","apple          100\n","muskmelon      100\n","watermelon     100\n","grapes         100\n","mango          100\n","banana         100\n","pomegranate    100\n","lentil         100\n","blackgram      100\n","mungbean       100\n","mothbeans      100\n","pigeonpeas     100\n","kidneybeans    100\n","chickpea       100\n","coffee         100\n","Name: crop, dtype: int64\n"]}],"source":["# print the keys\n","print(crops.keys())\n","\n","# Check shape of the data\n","print(crops.shape)\n","\n","# Print missing values for each column\n","print(crops.isna().sum().sort_values())\n","\n","# Print the list of counts of distinct values of the crop column\n","print(crops['crop'].value_counts())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"2cd79bfa-7025-46a8-912f-5df7c792ff85","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4475,"lastExecutedAt":1709820360335,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Visualize the relationship between the features and the target variable\nsns.pairplot(crops, hue='crop', vars=['N', 'P', 'K', 'ph'], markers='D')\nplt.show()"},"outputs":[],"source":["# #
